## Why mermaid?

```
The main purpose of Mermaid is to help with Visualizing Documentation, and helping it catch up with Development.

Diagramming and Documentation cost precious developer time and get outdated quickly. However, not having diagrams or documentation ruins productivity and hampers organizational learning.

Mermaid addresses this Catch-22 situation by reducing the time, effort and tooling that is required to create modifiable diagrams and charts which in turn results in smarter and more reusable content. Mermaid, as a text-based diagramming tool allows for quick and easy updates and makes documentation much easier. It can also be included in production scripts and other pieces of code as per requirement.
