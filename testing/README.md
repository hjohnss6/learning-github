This documents some things around testing for python.
Uses pytest specifically.


```
Pytest is a python based testing framework, which is used
to write and execute test codes. In the present days of REST
services, pytest is mainly used for API testing even though
we can use pytest to write simple to complex tests, i.e.,
we can write codes to test API, database, UI, etc.
